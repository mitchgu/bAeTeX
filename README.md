# bAeTeX

LaTeX is nice for two things: mathematical notation and making documents look really damn nice. For things like positioning or customization, I've found it to be a nightmare.

bAeTeX is a mashup of modern frontend technologies and LaTeX's nice math features. It uses a simple gulpfile with pug, sass, and js source files that are statically compiled to the final output.
With the help of print styles, documents are fully printable or exportable as PDF. Almost all of LaTeX's math features are achievable through MathJAX, and with any luck the typography will look as pretty as LaTeX too.

## Getting started
1. `npm install`
2. `gulp`
